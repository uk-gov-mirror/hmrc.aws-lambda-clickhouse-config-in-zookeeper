Zookeeper obtains the configuration for certain Clickhouse configuration files via a lambda which injects the 'remote-servers' config into Zookeeper.

Please check the [telemetry-terraform](https://github.com/hmrc/telemetry-terraform) repository for details on how this Lambda is deployed.

## Requirements

* [Python 3.14+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Quick start

```shell
# Install correct version of Python
pyenv install $(cat .python-version)

# Optional set up environment variables
export POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true
export PYTHONPATH=/home/james/hmrcDev/aws-lambda-clickhouse-config-in-zookeeper
export MDTP_ENVIRONMENT=integration

# Run tests:
make test

# Package the lambda locally:
make package
```

### Environment variables
The following environment variables are processed by the lambda handler and can therefore be set in Terraform to
override the defaults provided:

* `lambda_name` (default: "clickhouse-config-in-zookeeper")
* `log_level` (default: "INFO")
